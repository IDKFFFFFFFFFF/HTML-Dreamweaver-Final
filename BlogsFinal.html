	  <p> Esports insider 1 Released 27 of December 2022:
	Angels and Unicorns: Top 5 esports investments stories of 2022 
This article talks about the biggest investments in esports in 2022. It talks about investments and merges like the merge of ESL and FACE IT, this had some criticism for “esportswashing”. It mentions other huge things like FaZe Clan going public and it being one of the only companies in esports that have gone public. It talks about the MISFITS gaming group leaving LEC after being in there since 2016, the company after leaving started a $20M creator fund, which will help them fund several content creation projects. Finally, it talks about ReKT Global being acquired by Infinite Reality and Fly Quest being acquired by Florida Panthers owners, which is an NHL hockey team. 
My opinion on the article is that it is a very good summary of big events in the Esports industry this year, especially when it talked about Faze going public, for a gaming company to go public really shows how Esports is going to grow into an even more mainstream thing that it already has become. 
The article conveys the message well and explains the whole side of the story in the short text that it has, it shows how the community reacted, if it might help the, company, and the reasons for the action.
The article does go in depth in some parts but it is also very easy to read and has simple information to receive and understand. 
Was is interesting about the article is that at the start of it talks about how after 2 years of the pandemic how everyone in the esports industry expected 2022 to be "a renaissance of sorts". I found it really interesting that it mentioned this because it makes it sound like there were higher expectations for this year in esports even though it was a year with big accomplishments like Faze going public.</p>

	<p>Posted on the 6th of January 2023&nbsp; &nbsp; The game valve has revealed the locations for its 3 Dota 2 Majors in 2023. The majors in winter will take place in LIma, Peru while the spring tour will conclude in Berlin. Indonesia will host the Summer tour.  This is the first time any major esport tournament is held in Peru. 

Opinion on the Article: I think it is a good quick article for people who are interested in valve after all these years. Dota 2 with a not so big, but strong community with one of the biggest esports of all time is taking place in Peru for the first time, that is big news for the esports world. 
The article conveys the message but I think it fails to mention how big of news it is for the tournament in winter to be held in Lima Peru, I think it should be emphasized a bit more. 
This article is very surface level, it is short, but it tells all the info that is needed for this story. 
Something that is interesting about this article is that it talks about how Dota 2 majors are one of the most viewed things on esports, but does not talk about how important it is that it is being held in Peru, this just shows how big esports is getting. </p>

It is to be released on January 24th and is called Game and Glory. CS:GO fans and pros will be able to share their stories and have them in the documentary. 
	      
	      Opinion: I think the article mentions it perfectly and shows how big of a deal this is in the gaming community. 
	      I think this article conveys the message very well and talks about how a large production of a game can be a gamechanger for the esports community. 
	      The article is fairly in depth, but overall very simple. It tells you everything you need to know about what this is and who is involved like BBC and ESL gaming. 
	      I think this article is interesting because it shows how mainstream esports has become and how it will evolve, for example now there will be a large scale production on a documentary about CSGO. </p>
